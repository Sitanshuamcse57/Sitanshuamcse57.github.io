title: "amFOSS Task Experience"
---

**Hello,** 

I would like to share my experience about cracking the **amFOSS tasks**.

I started learning python by watching you tube videos and going through documentation, though it was bit lengthy, I tried to complete my tasks as far as I could.

As days passed on, I learnt many new things and got confidence in myself in attending to tasks.

The task I found interesting is setting up personal website by using gitHub pages.

Eventhough it just appears very minute tasks, work that facinated me that goes on behind scenes from the moment the commit is received by gitHub to those being deployed.

I have learnt a lot. I was overwhelmed initially by looking at the document but reading through each task and follwoing the instructions/documentation provided made it easier to work.
